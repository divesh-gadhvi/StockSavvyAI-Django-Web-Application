## Introduction
<p>
  Stock market investments can be a risky endeavor for many people due to the volatility and complexity of the market. With the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence, stock prediction systems have become an increasingly popular solution for investors looking to make informed decisions. StockSavvyAI is a web application that provides StockPredictHQ, a stock market prediction service. Our service utilizes an LSTM model to predict the stock prices of various publicly traded companies.
  
  The StockPredictHQ web service uses a range of financial data from Yahoo Finance to perform stock market prediction. The data collected from Yahoo Finance includes the opening and closing price of the stock, the highest and lowest price reached during the trading day, the adjusted closing price, the total number of shares traded, and the date of the stock market data recorded. The company name is also recorded to distinguish between different companies' stocks. The closing price is the target variable for the stock market prediction. These data columns are used to train machine learning models to predict the closing price of the stock on a given date.

The web application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily input the companies they want to predict and view the predictions in real-time. The predictions are displayed in a visually appealing manner, with charts and graphs that provide an easy-to-understand representation of the predicted stock prices along with details about the company.
  
  The web application is an excellent tool for users to make informed investment decisions.
